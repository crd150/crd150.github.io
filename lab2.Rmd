In this guide you will learn how to download, clean and manage data - a process known as Data Wrangling - in R. You will be working with data on California counties. The objectives of this guide are as follows

1. Learn how to read data into R
2. Learn about tidyverse
3. Learn data wrangling functions

This lab guide follows closely and supplements the material presented in Chapters 3, 7-9, and 14 in the textbook [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) (RDS) and the class Handout 2.

<p class="comment">**Assignment 2 is due by 12:00 pm, January 21st on Canvas.**   See [here](https://crd150.github.io/hw_guidelines.html) for assignment guidelines. You must submit an `.Rmd` file and its associated `.html` file. Name the files: yourLastName_firstInitial_asgn02. For example: brazil_n_asgn02.</p>    


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

## **Open up a R Markdown file**
\

Rather than working directly from the R console, I recommended typing in lab code into an R Markdown and working from there.  This will give you more practice and experience working in the R Markdown environment, which you will need to do for all of your assignments.  Plus you can add your own comments to the code to ensure that you're understanding what is being done. Download the [lab template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crd150/data/master/labtemplate.Rmd) into an appropriate folder on your hard drive (preferably, a folder named 'Lab 2'), open it in R Studio, and type and run your lab code there.  The template is also located on Canvas under Files. Change the title ("Lab 2") and insert your name and date. Don't change anything else inside the YAML (the stuff at the top in between the `---`).  Also keep the grey chunk after the YAML. For a rundown on the use of R Markdown, see the [assignment guidelines](https://crd150.github.io/hw_guidelines.html).


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **R Packages**
\

At the end of [Lab 1](https://crd150.github.io/lab1.html#Functions) we learned about R functions. Functions do not exist in a vacuum, but exist within [R packages](https://r-pkgs.org/intro.html).  Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data. At the top left of a function's help documentation, you'll find in curly brackets the R package that the function is housed in.  For example, type in your console `? seq`. At the top left of the help documentation, you'll find that `seq()` is in the package **base**.  All the functions we have used so far are part of packages that have been pre-installed and pre-loaded into R. For all new packages, you need to install and load them.

In this lab and all labs from here on out, we will be using commands from the package **tidyverse**. [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a collection of high-powered, consistent, and easy-to-use packages developed by a number of thoughtful and talented R developers.  In order to use functions in a new package, you first need to install the package using the `install.packages()` command. 

```{r, error=TRUE, results="hide", warning = FALSE, messages = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

You should see a bunch of gobbledygook roll through your console screen.  Don't worry, that's just R downloading all of the other packages and applications that **tidyverse** relies on.  These are known as [dependencies](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html#dependencies).  Unless you get a message in red that indicates there is an error (like we saw in [Lab 1](https://crd150.github.io/lab1.html#R_Data_Types) when we typed in hello world without quotes), you should be fine.

Next, you will need to load the package into your working environment.  You need to do this every time you start RStudio. We do this using the `library()` function.  Notice there are no quotes around **tidyverse** this time.

```{r warning=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

The Packages window at the lower-right of your RStudio shows all the packages you currently have installed.  If you don't have a package listed in this window, you'll need to use the `install.packages()` function to install it.  If the package is checked, that means it is loaded into your current R session

For example, here is a section of my Packages window

<br>

<center>
![](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/CRD150/Lab/crd150.github.io/window1.png)

</center>
\

<br>

The only packages loaded into my current session is **methods**, a package that is loaded every time you open an R session.  Let's say we use `install.packages()` to install the package **matrixStats**. The window now looks like

<br>

<center>
![](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/CRD150/Lab/crd150.github.io/window2.png)

</center>
\


When you load it in using `library()`, a check mark appears next to **matrixStats**

<br>

<center>
![](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/CRD150/Lab/crd150.github.io/window3.png)

</center>
\

<br>

**Note that you only need to install packages once (`install.pacakges()`), but you need to load them each time you relaunch RStudio (`library()`)**.  Repeat after me: Install once, library every time. This means your R Markdown should never have the function `install.pacakges()` but will likely always have the function `library()`.

Are you ready to enter the **tidyverse**? Yes, of course, so here is a badge!  Wear it proudly my young friends! And away we go!

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Reading data**
\

One of the first steps in the Data Wrangling process is to read in your dataset. Most of the data files you will encounter are comma-delimited (or comma-separated) files, which have `.csv` extensions.  Comma-delimited means that columns are separated by commas.  I uploaded a file on Canvas (Files - Week 2 - Lab) containing the number of Hispanic, white, Asian, and black residents in 2018 in California counties taken from the United States [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs).  Download the file *week2data.csv* and save it into the same folder where your Lab 2 R Markdown file resides. The record layout/codebook for the file can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crd150/data/master/week2data_codebook.txt).  


```{r warning=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
counties <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crd150/data/master/week2data.csv")
```

To read in the csv file, first make sure that R is pointed to the folder you saved your data into.  Type in `getwd()` to find out the current directory and `setwd("directory name")` to set the directory to the folder containing the data.  In my Mac OS computer, the file is located in the folder shown in the figure below.

<center>
![Directory path where your data reside](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/CRD150/Lab/crd150.github.io/setwd.png)

</center>

Using a Mac laptop, I type in the following command to set the directory to the folder containing my data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd("~/Documents/UCD/CRD150/Labs/Lab 2")
```

For a Windows system, you can find the pathway of a file by right clicking on it and selecting Properties. You will find that instead of a forward slash like in a Mac, a Windows path will be indicated by a single back slash `\`.  R doesn't like this because it thinks of a single back slash as an [escape character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character).  Use instead two back slashes `\\` 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd("C:\\Users\\noli\\Desktop\\Classes\\CRD150\\Lab 2")
```

or a forward slash `/`.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/noli/Desktop/Classes/CRD150/Lab 2")
```

You can also manually set the working directory by clicking on Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory.

<br>

Once you've set your directory, use the function `read_csv()` and plug in the name of the file in quotes inside the parentheses.  Make sure you include the *.csv* extension.  


```{r eval = FALSE}
counties <- read_csv("week2data.csv")
```

You should see the object *counties* pop up in your Environment window (top right). First thing you should do when you bring in a data set is to look at it to make sure you know what you have and nothing went drastically wrong when reading in the data.  One way to look at the data is to print it on your screen.  Do this using the `glimpse()` command

```{r}
glimpse(counties)
```

You get a quick, compact summary of your data The function takes one argument: the name of a data frame.  It then tells us how many rows it has, how many variables there are, what these variables are called, and what kind of data are associated with each variable. This function is useful when we’re working with a data set containing many variables.

If you like viewing your data through an Excel style worksheet, type in `View(counties)`, and *counties* should pop up in the top left window of your R Studio interface. Scroll up and down, left and right. Take some time to understand the format of the data set. What do the columns represent? Rows?


**tidyverse** can read in more than just .csv files. It has a suite of `read_` functions that are a part of the subpackage **readr**.  The goal of **readr** is to provide a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like csv, tsv, and fwf). It is designed to flexibly parse many types of data found in the wild, while still cleanly failing when data unexpectedly changes. To learn more about these functions, see **readr**'s dedicated [site](https://readr.tidyverse.org/index.html).

By learning how to read in data, you've earned another **tidyverse** badge! Hooray!

<center>
![](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/CRD150/Lab/crd150.github.io/readr.png){ width=25% }

</center>


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Tibbles**
\

The data set that you brought in above using `read_csv()` saved the file in a special R object known as a *tibble*.  Although the **tidyverse** works with all data objects, its fundamental object type is the tibble. Tibbles are essentially a special variant of data frames that have desirable properties for printing and joining.  To illustrate comparisons between tibbles and regular data frames, let's bring in the county data we downloaded above but using the function `read.csv()`, which will bring in files as regular data frames.  

```{r echo = FALSE}
counties.df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crd150/data/master/week2data.csv")
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
counties.df <- read.csv("week2data.csv")
```

The first difference between regular data frames and tibbles is how the dataset "looks."  First, the tibble.

```{r}
counties
```

Tibbles have a refined print method that shows only the first 10 rows, and only the columns that fit on the screen.  In addition, each column reports its name and type.

Tibbles are designed so that you don't accidentally overwhelm your console when you print large data frames.  Compare the print output above to what you get with a data frame

```{r eval = FALSE}
counties.df
```

Ugly, right? 

Not all functions work with tibbles, particularly those that are specific to spatial data. As such, we'll be using a combination of tibbles and regular data frames throughout the class, with a preference towards tibbles where possible.  Note that when you search on Google for how to do something in R, you will likely get non tidyverse ways of doing things.  Most of these suggestions are fine, but some are not and may screw you up down the road.  For example, always use `read_csv()` to read in data. Do not use `read.csv()`. My advice is to try to stick with tidyverse functions to do things in R. This is why our textbook RDS is a valuable resource. 


Anyway, you earned another badge. Yes!

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Data Wrangling** 
\

It is rare that the data you download are in exactly the right form for analysis.  For example, rather than all counties in the tibble *counties*, you might want to analyze just Northern California counties. Or you might want to discard certain variables from the dataset to reduce clutter. 

In this lab, we won't have time to go through all of the methods and functions in R that are associated with the data wrangling process. We will cover more in Lab 3 and later labs. Many methods you will have to learn on your own given the specific tasks you will need to accomplish.  In the rest of this guide, we'll go through some of the basic data wrangling techniques using the functions found in the package **dplyr**, which was automatically installed and loaded when you brought in the **tidyverse** package.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Selecting variables**
\

In practice, most of the data files you will download will contain variables you won't need. It is easier to work with a smaller dataset as it reduces clutter and clears up memory space, which is important if you are executing complex tasks on a large number of observations.  Use the command `select()` to keep variables by name.  Visually, we are doing this (taken from the RStudio [cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf))  

<center>
![](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/CRD150/Lab/crd150.github.io/subsetcols.png)

</center>


To see the names of variables in the dataset *counties*, use the `names()` command.  

```{r}
names(counties)
```

Let's keep *GEOID*, *name*, *hisp*, *nhasn*, *nhblk*, *nhwhite*, and *tpopr*

```{r}
select(counties, GEOID, name, hisp, nhasn, nhblk, nhwhite, tpopr)
```

A shortcut way of doing this is to use the `:` operator.

```{r}
select(counties, GEOID, name, hisp:tpopr)
```

The `:` operator tells R to select all the variables from *hisp* to *tpopr*.  This operator is useful when you've got a lot of variables to keep and they all happen to be ordered sequentially.

You can use the `select()` command to keep variables *except* for the ones you designate.  For example, to keep all variables in *counties* except *state*, and save this change back into a new tibble called *counties1*, type in

```{r, results="hide"}
counties1 <- select(counties, -state)
```

The negative sign tells R to exclude the variable named right after. You can delete multiple variables.  For example, if you wanted to keep all variables except *name* and *state*, you would type in `select(counties, -name, -state)`.


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Creating new variables**
\

The `mutate()` function allows you to create new variables within your dataset.  This is important when you need to transform variables in some way - for example, calculating a ratio or adding two variables together.  Visually, you are doing this

<center>
![](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/CRD150/Lab/crd150.github.io/mutate.png)

</center>

You can use the `mutate()` command to generate as many new variables as you would like.  For example, let's construct five new variables in *counties1*: the proportion of residents who are non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic. Name these variables *pnhwhite*, *pnhasn*, *pnhblk*, and *phisp*, respectively.

```{r, results="hide"}
mutate(counties1, pnhwhite = nhwhite/tpopr, pnhasn = nhasn/tpopr, 
              pnhblk = nhblk/tpopr, phisp = hisp/tpopr)
```
  
Note that you can create new variables based on the variables you just created in the same line of code (Wow!). For example, you can create a variable named *diff* that represents the difference between the percent non-Hispanic white and percent non-Hispanic black after creating both variables within the same `mutate()` command. Let’s save these changes back into *counties1*

```{r, results="hide"}
counties1 <- mutate(counties1, pnhwhite = nhwhite/tpopr, pnhasn = nhasn/tpopr, 
              pnhblk = nhblk/tpopr, phisp = hisp/tpopr,
              diff = pnhwhite-phisp)
```

View *counties1* to verify that you've successfully created these variables.


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Filtering**
\

Filtering means selecting rows/observations based on their values.  To filter in R, use the command `filter()`.  Visually, filtering rows looks like this.

<center>
![](/Users/noli/Documents/UCD/teaching/CRD150/Lab/crd150.github.io/subsetrows.png)

</center>

The first argument in the parentheses of this command is the name of the data frame. The second and any subsequent arguments (separated by commas) are the expressions that filter the data frame. For example, we can keep just Sacramento county from *counties1* using its [FIPS code](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/ca/home/?cid=nrcs143_013697)

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(counties1, GEOID == "06067")
```

The double equal operator `==` means equal to.  The command is telling R to keep the rows in *counties1* whose *GEOID* equals "06067".  There are quotes around 06067 because *GEOID* is a character variable.  

We can also explicitly exclude cases and keep everything else by using the not equal operator `!=`.  The following code *excludes* Sacramento county.

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(counties1, GEOID != "06067")
```

What about filtering if a county has a value greater than a specified value?  For example, counties with a proportion Hispanic greater than 0.5 (50%). 

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(counties1, phisp > 0.50)
```

What about less than 0.5 (50%)?

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(counties1, phisp < 0.50)
```

Both lines of code do not include counties that have a proportion Hispanic equal to 0.5.  We include it by using the less than or equal operator `<=` or greater than or equal operator `>=`.

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(counties1, phisp <= 0.5)
```

In addition to comparison operators, filtering may also utilize logical operators that make multiple selections.  There are three basic logical operators: `&` (and), `|` (or), and `!` (not).  We can keep counties with *phisp* greater than 0.5 **and** *pnhasn* greater than 0.05 by using `&`.

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(counties1, phisp > 0.50 & pnhasn > 0.05)
```

Use `|` to keep counties with a *GEOID* of "06067" (Sacramento) **or** "06113" (Yolo) 

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(counties1, GEOID == "06067" | GEOID == "06113")
```


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Arrange**
\

We use the `arrange()` function to sort a data frame by one or more variables. You might want to do this to get a sense of which cases have the highest or lowest values in your data set or sort counties by their name. For example, let's sort in ascending order counties by proportion Hispanic.

```{r}
arrange(counties1, phisp)
```

[Trinity county](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_County,_California) has the lowest percent Hispanic with 7.19.

By default, `arrange()` sorts in ascending order. We can sort by a variable in descending order by using the `desc()` function on the variable we want to sort by. For example, to sort the dataframe by *phisp* in descending order we use

```{r}
arrange(counties1, desc(phisp))
```

[Imperial county](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_County,_California) has the largest percent Hispanic with 83.4.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Pipes**
\

One of the important innovations from the tidyverse is the pipe operator `%>%`.  You use the pipe operator when you want to combine multiple operations into one continuous line of code.  For example, we can use a pipe to combine all the commands we executed on the object *counties* from the sections *Selecting variables* to *Filtering* in one continuous line of code.

```{r}
counties2 <- counties %>% 
            select(-state) %>% 
            mutate(pnhwhite = nhwhite/tpopr, pnhasn = nhasn/tpopr, 
                    pnhblk = nhblk/tpopr, phisp = hisp/tpopr,
                    diff = pnhwhite-phisp) %>% 
            filter(GEOID == "06067" | GEOID == "06113")
```

<br>

Let's break down what the pipe is doing here.  First, you start out with your dataset *counties*.  You "pipe" `%>%` that into the command `select()`.  Notice that you didn't have to type in *counties* inside the `select()` command - `%>%` pipes that in for you.  `select()` deletes *state* and then pipes this result into the command `mutate()` to create new variables. This tibble gets piped to `filter()` to select just Davis and Yolo counties. Finally, the code saves the result into a new tibble *counties2* which we designated at the beginning with the arrow operator. 

Piping makes code clearer, and simultaneously gets rid of the need to define any intermediate objects that you would have needed to keep track of while reading the code. PIPE, Pipe, and pipe whenever you can. Badge it!

</center>

\

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Saving Data**
\

Let's save a dataset containing race/ethnicity for Sacramento and Yolo counties.  Use `write_csv()` to save the data frame or tibble as a csv file in the folder of your current working directory.

```{r eval = FALSE}
write_csv(counties2, "lab2_file.csv")
```

The first argument is the name of the R object you want to save. The second argument is the name of the csv file in quotes. Make sure to add the .csv extension. The file is saved in the folder you set as the current working directory (remember, use `getwd()` to determine the current directory). You're done! [Time to celebrate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GwjfUFyY6M).

## **Assignment 2**
\

Download and open the [Assignment 2 R Markdown Script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crd150/data/master/yourLastName_firstInitial_asgn02.Rmd). The script can also be found on Canvas (Files - Week 2 - Assignment). Any response requiring a data analysis task  must be supported by code you generate to produce your result. Just examining your various objects in the “Environment” section of R Studio is insufficient—you must use scripted commands. Submit the `Rmd` and its knitted `html` files on Canvas. We've put together some additional R tips [here](https://crd150.github.io/tips.html) in the likely case you get stuck. 

<br>

1. Download the file *q2data.csv* from Canvas (Files -> Week 2 -> Assignment).  Make sure you download it into an appropriate folder on your hard drive. A codebook is also provided.

a. Read the file into R. (1 point)
b. How many rows are included in the file? What does each row represent? Remember that whenever you can, you need to use code to answer the questions. (2 points)
c. How many columns are included in the file? What does each column represent? (2 points)
d. Conduct the following data wrangling tasks.  Use the pipe operator to do all of these tasks in one continuous line of code.  Note that you have to decide the appropriate order of the tasks. (4 points)

* Keep the variables NAME, proportion White, Black and Hispanic, total population, and the difference between Hispanic and White income.
* Create variables containing the proportion White, Black and Hispanic.
* Create a variable subtracting White household income from Hispanic household income.
* Save the changes into a tibble named *q2clean*

e. How many observations have a percent Hispanic greater than 50% *and* have Hispanic households earning more than white households? (2 points)

<br>

2. The data set *babynames* contains the number of children of each sex given each name for each year from 1880 to 2017 as collected by the Social Security Administration. All names with more than 5 uses are given. Let's strengthen your data wrangling skills by exploring this unique data set.  Install the package **babynames**.  Run the code `library(babynames)`, `data(babynames)` and `head(babynames)`. You should see the tibble *babynames* pop up in your global environment window. Type in `? babynames` to get a description of this dataset.

a. What was the most popular female baby name in 2017? What about male? (3 points)
b. Does your name appear in the dataset? If yes, what year was it the most popular? (3 points)
c. Is the name "Madison" a more popular Male or Female name in 2017? What about in 1984? (3 points)
