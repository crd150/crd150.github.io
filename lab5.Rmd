In this guide you will acquire the skills needed to process and present spatial data in R.  The objectives of the guide are as follows 


1. Understand how spatial data are processed in R
2. Learn basic data wrangling operations on spatial data
3. Learn how to make a map in R

This guide focuses exclusively on polygon or areal data.  You will have the opportunity to handle and examine point data in Lab 7. This lab guide follows closely and supplements the material presented in Chapters 2.1, 2.2, and 8 in the textbook [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) (GWR) and class Handout 5.

<br>

<p class="comment">**Assignment 5 is due by 12:00 pm, February 11th on Canvas.**  See [here](https://crd150.github.io/hw_guidelines.html) for assignment guidelines.  You must submit an `.Rmd` file and its associated `.html` file. Name the files: yourLastName_firstInitial_asgn05. For example: brazil_n_asgn05.</p>


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Open up a R Markdown file**
\

Download the [Lab template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crd150/data/master/labtemplate.Rmd) into an appropriate folder on your hard drive (preferably, a folder named 'Lab 5'), open it in R Studio, and type and run your code there. The template is also located on Canvas under Files.  Change the title ("Lab 5") and insert your name and date. Don't change anything else inside the YAML (the stuff at the top in between the `---`).  Also keep the grey chunk after the YAML. For a rundown on the use of R Markdown, see the [assignment guidelines](https://crd150.github.io/hw_guidelines.html)

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Installing and loading packages**
\

You’ll need to install the following packages in R. You only need to do this once, so if you’ve already installed these packages, skip the code. Also, don’t put these `install.packages()` commands in your R Markdown document. Copy and paste the code in the R Console. We’ll talk about what functions these packages provide as they come up in the guide.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf")
install.packages("tigris")
install.packages("tmap")
```

You’ll need to load the following packages using `library()`. Unlike installing, you will always need to load packages whenever you start a new R session. 

```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
library(sf)
library(tigris)
library(tmap)
```

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Spatial data in R**
\

The main package we will use for handling spatial data in R is the tidy friendly **sf** package.  **sf** stands for simple features.  What is a feature? A feature is thought of as a thing, or an object in the real world, such as a building or a tree.  A county can be a feature. As can a city and a neighborhood.  Features have a geometry describing where on Earth the features are located, and they have attributes, which describe other properties. Think back to [Lab 3](https://crd150.github.io/lab3.html) - we were working with counties.  The difference between what we were doing then and what we will be doing in this lab is that counties in Lab 3 had attributes (e.g. percent Hispanic, total population), but they did not have geometries. As such, we could not put them on a map because we didn't have their specific geographic coordinates. This is what separates nonspatial and spatial data in R.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Bringing in spatial data**
\

**sf** is the specific type of data object that deals with spatial information in R. Think back to [Lab 1](https://crd150.github.io/lab1.html#R_Data_Structures) when we discussed the various ways R stores data - **sf** is just another way.  But please note that spatial data themselves outside of R can take on many different formats. We'll be primarily working with shapefiles in this class.  [Shapefiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) are not the only type of spatial data, but they are the most commonly used. Let's be clear here: **sf** objects are R specific and shapefiles are a general format of spatial data.  This is like tibbles are R specific and csv files are a general format of non spatial data. 

We will be primarily working with census geographic data in this lab and pretty much all future labs. If you need a reminder of the Census geographies, go back to Handout 3. There are two major packages for bringing in Census shapefiles into R: **tidycensus** and **tigris**.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **tidycensus**
\

In [Lab 3](https://crd150.github.io/lab3.html#Using_the_Census_API), we worked with the **tidycensus** package and the Census API to bring in Census data into R.  Fortunately, we can use the same commands to bring in Census geographic data.  First, load in your Census API key.

```{r eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="hide"}
census_api_key("YOUR API KEY GOES HERE")
```

Then use the `get_acs()` command to bring in California tract-level median household income, total foreign-born population, and total population.  Remember that "E" at the end of the variable indicates "Estimate" and "M" indicates margin of errors.

```{r warning=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE}
ca.tracts <- get_acs(geography = "tract", 
              year = 2019,
              variables = c(medincome = "B19013_001", 
                            fb = "B05012_003", totp = "B05012_001"), 
              state = "CA",
              survey = "acs5",
              output = "wide",
              geometry = TRUE)
```

The only difference between the code above and what we used in Lab 3 is we have one additional argument added to the `get_acs()` command: `geometry = TRUE`.  This command tells R to bring in the spatial features associated with the geography you specified in the command, in our case California tracts. You can further narrow your geographic scope to the county level by typing in `county =` as an argument.  For example, to get just Sacramento county tracts, you would type in `county = "Sacramento"`. Type in *ca.tracts* to see what we've got.

```{r}
ca.tracts
```

<br>

The object looks much like a basic tibble, but with a few differences.  

* You'll find that the description of the object now indicates that it is a simple feature collection with 8 fields (attributes or columns of data).  There are 8057 features, in this case, census tracts.
* The `geometry_type` indicates that the spatial data are in `MULTIPOLYGON` form (as opposed to points or lines, the other basic vector data forms, which were discussed in Handout 5).  
* `bbox` stands for bounding box, which indicates the spatial extent of the features (from left to right, for example, California tracts go from a longitude of -124.4096 to -114.1312).  
* `epsg` and `proj4string` are related to the coordinate reference system, which we'll touch on later in the quarter.  
* The final difference is that the data frame contains the column *geometry*.  This geometry is what makes this data frame spatial. Remember that a tibble is a data frame. Hence, an **sf** objective is basically a tibble, or has tibble like qualities.  This means that we can use nearly all of the functions we've learned in the past three labs on **sf** objects. Hooray for consistency!

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div> 
### **tigris package**
\

Another package that allows us to bring in census geographic boundaries is **tigris**.  [Here](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris/blob/master/README.md) is a list of all the geographies you can download through this package.  Let's bring in the boundaries for Sacramento city.  Remember from Handout 3 that cities are designated as places by the Census. Use the `places()` function to get all places in California.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results = FALSE}
pl <- places(state = "CA", cb = TRUE, year=2019)
```

<br>

The `cb = TRUE`  argument tells R to download a [generalized cartographic boundary](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/naming-convention/cartographic-boundary-file.html) file, which drastically reduces the size of the data (compare the file size when you don't include `cb = TRUE`).  For example, it eliminates all areas that are strictly covered by water (e.g. lakes).   The argument `year=2019` tells R to bring in the boundaries for that year (census geographies can change from year to year). When using the multi-year ACS, best to use the end year of the period. In the `get_acs()` command above we used `year=2019`, so also use `year=2019` in the `places()` command.  Note that unlike the **tidycensus** package, **tigris** does not allow you to attach attribute data (e.g. percent Hispanic, total population, etc.) to geometric features.

We can use `filter()` to keep Sacramento city.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results = FALSE}
sac.city <- filter(pl, NAME == "Sacramento")
sac.city
```

The argument `NAME == "Sacramento"` tells R to keep cities with the exact city name "Sacramento". 

Let's use use the function `counties()` to bring in county boundaries. 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results = FALSE}
counties <- counties(cb = TRUE, year=2019, state = "CA")
```

To get Sacramento county, we use the `filter()` function. 

```{r}
sac.county <- filter(counties, NAME == "Sacramento")
```

Guess what? You earned another badge! Yipee!!

</div> 
### **Reading from your hard drive**
\

Directly reading spatial files using an API is great, but doesn't exist for many spatial data sources. You'll often have to download a spatial data set, save it onto your hard drive and read it into R.  The function for reading spatial files from your hard drive as **sf** objects is `st_read()`.

Let's bring in a shapefile I created that contains median housing values for census tracts in Sacramento county.  I zipped up the file and uploaded it onto Github. Make sure your current working directory is pointed to the appropriate folder on your hard drive (use `setwd()`). Use the following code to download and unzip the file. 

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
download.file(url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crd150/data/master/SacramentoCountyTracts.zip", destfile = "SacramentoCountyTracts.zip")
unzip(zipfile = "SacramentoCountyTracts.zip")
```

<br>

Don't worry if you don't understand these commands - they are more for you to simply copy and paste so that you can download files that I zipped up and uploaded onto Github.  You can look at the help documentation for each function if you are curious.

You should see the *SacramentoCountyTracts* files in your current working directory (type in `getwd()` to find where these files reside on your hard drive). Note that the shapefile is actually not a single file but is represented by multiple files, specifically four files named *SacramentoCountyTracts* with shp, dbf, prj, and shx extensions.  These files are all connected to one another, so don't manually alter these files.  Moreover, if you want to remove a shapefile from your hard drive, delete all the associated files not just one.

Bring in this Sacramento County tract shapefile using the function `st_read()`.  You'll need to add the *.shp* extension so that the function knows it's reading in a shapefile.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = "hide"}
sac.county.tracts <- st_read("SacramentoCountyTracts.shp", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

The argument `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` tells R to keep any variables that look like a character as a character and not a [factor](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html), which we won't use much, if at all, in this class.


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Data Wrangling**
\

There is a lot of stuff [behind the curtain](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html) of how R handles spatial data as simple features, but the main takeaway is that **sf** objects are data frames.  This means you can use many of the functions we've learned in the past couple labs to manipulate **sf** objects, and this includes our best buddy the pipe `%>%` operator.  For example, let's do the following data wrangling tasks on *ca.tracts*.

1. Drop the margins of errors
2. Rename the variables
3. Calculate percent foreign born

We do all of this in one line of continuous code using the pipe operator `%>%`

```{r results='hide'}
ca.tracts <- ca.tracts %>%
            select(-medincomeM, -fbM, -totpM) %>%
            rename(medincome = medincomeE, fb = fbE, totp = totpE) %>%
            mutate(pfb = fb/totp)
```

Notice that we've already used all of the functions above for nonspatial data wrangling. 
Another important operation is to join attribute data to an **sf** object.  For example, let's say you wanted to add tract level percent race/ethnicity, which is located in a csv file I've uploaded on GitHub

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ca.race <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crd150/data/master/californiatractsrace.csv")
```

Remember, were dealing with data frames here, so we can use `left_join()`, which we covered in [Lab 3](https://crd150.github.io/lab3.html#Joining_tables), to join the non spatial data frame *ca.race* to the spatial data frame *sac.county.tracts*.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sac.county.tracts <- sac.county.tracts %>%
  left_join(ca.race, by = "GEOID")
sac.county.tracts
```  

The main takeaway: **sf** objects are data frames, so you can use many of the functions you've learned in the past couple of labs on these objects.  


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Saving shapefiles**
\

To save an **sf** object to a file, use the function `st_write()` and specify at least two arguments, the **sf** object you want to save and a file name in quotes with the file extension. You'll also need to specify `delete_layer = TRUE` which overwrites the existing file if it already exists in your current working directory.  Make sure you've set your directory to the folder you want your file to be saved in.  Type in `getwd()` to see your current directory and use `setwd()` to set the directory.

Let's save *sac.county.tracts* as a shapefile named *saccountytractslab5.shp*.  

```{r message=FALSE, results = FALSE}
st_write(sac.county.tracts, "saccountytractslab5.shp", delete_layer = TRUE)
```

Check your current working directory to see if the file *saccountytractslab5.shp* was saved.

You can save your **sf** object in a number of different data formats other than `shp`.  We won't be concerned too much with these other formats in this class, but you can see a list of them [here](https://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html).


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Mapping in R**
\

Now that you've got your spatial data in and wrangled, the next natural step is to map something. There are several functions in R that can be used for mapping.  We won't go through all of them, but GWR outlines in Table 8.1 the range of mapping packages available in R.  The package we'll rely on in this class for mapping is **tmap**.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **tmap**
\

The foundation function for mapping in **tmap** is `tm_shape()`.  You then build on `tm_shape()` by adding one or more elements, all taking on the form of `tm_`.  Let's make a choropleth map of median housing values. 

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
tm_shape(sac.county.tracts) +
  tm_polygons(col = "medhval", style = "quantile")
```

You first put the dataset *sac.county.tracts* inside `tm_shape()`. Because you are plotting polygons, you use `tm_polygons()` next. The argument `col = "medhval"` tells R to shade the tracts by the variable *medhval*.  **tmap** allows users to specify the classification style with the `style` argument. The argument `style = "quantile"` tells R to break up the shading into quantiles, or equal groups of 5. Seven of the most useful classification styles are described in the bullet points below (taken from GWR):

* `style = pretty`, the default setting, rounds breaks into whole numbers where possible and spaces them evenly
* `style = equal` divides input values into bins of equal range, and is appropriate for variables with a uniform distribution (not recommended for variables with a skewed distribution as the resulting map may end-up having little color diversity)
* `style = quantile` ensures the same number of observations fall into each category (with the potential down side that bin ranges can vary widely)
* `style = jenks` identifies groups of similar values in the data and maximizes the differences between categories
* `style = cont` (and `order`) present a large number of colors over continuous color field, and are particularly suited for continuous rasters (order can help visualize skewed distributions)
* `style = sd` divides the values by standard deviations above and below the mean.
* `style = cat` was designed to represent categorical values and assures that each category receives a unique color

What does the `equal` classification scheme provide us?

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
tm_shape(sac.county.tracts) +
  tm_polygons(col = "medhval", style = "equal")
```

We can see the visual difference between maps using `quantile` and `equal`. The importance of choosing the appropriate classification scheme is discussed in Handout 5.

Don't like the yellow/brown color scheme? We can change the color scheme using the argument `palette =` within `tm_polygons()`. The argument `palette =` defines the color ranges associated with the bins as determined by the `style` argument.  Below we use the color scheme "Reds" using `style = "quantile"`.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
tm_shape(sac.county.tracts) +
  tm_polygons(col = "medhval", style = "quantile",palette = "Reds") 
```

See Ch. 8.2.4 in GWR for a fuller discussion on color and other schemes you can specify.

The tract borders make it difficult to see the changes in color, specifically in downtown Sacramento (middle of the map) where there are a lot of smaller tracts.  We can make the borders transparent using the `border.alpha` argument.

```{r}
tm_shape(sac.county.tracts, unit = "mi") +
  tm_polygons(col = "medhval", style = "quantile",palette = "Reds", 
              border.alpha = 0)
```
              
We set `border.alpha` to 0 to indicate totally transparent. This eliminates the border colors between tracts.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Scale bar and arrow**
\

We need to add the other key map elements described in Handout 5. Here is where we start adding layout functions after `tm_polygons()` using the `+` operator.  First, the scale bar, which you can add using the function `tm_scale_bar()`

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
tm_shape(sac.county.tracts, unit = "mi") +
  tm_polygons(col = "medhval", style = "quantile",palette = "Reds", border.alpha = 0) +
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 5, 10), text.size  = 0.75, position = c("center", "bottom")) 
```

The argument `breaks` within `tm_scale_bar()` tells R the distances to break up and end the bar.  Make sure you use reasonable break points - the Sacramento county area is not, for example, 200 miles wide, so you should not use `c(0,100,200)` (try it and see what happens. You won't like it). Note that the scale is in miles (were in America!).  The default is in kilometers (the rest of the world!), but you can specify the units within `tm_shape()` using the argument `unit`.  Here, we used `unit = "mi"` to designate distance in the scale bar measured in miles.  The `position =` argument locates the scale bar on the bottom center of the map. The argument `text.size  =` controls the size of the scale bar.  We decrease the size  by 25%.

<br>

The next element is the north arrow, which we can add using the function `tm_compass()`.  You can control for the type, size and location of the arrow within this function.  We place a 4-star arrow on the top left of the map.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
tm_shape(sac.county.tracts, unit = "mi") +
  tm_polygons(col = "medhval", style = "quantile",palette = "Reds", border.alpha = 0) +
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 5, 10), text.size  = 0.75, position = c("center", "bottom"))  +
  tm_compass(type = "4star", position = c("left", "top")) 
```

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Legend**
\

There are many options to change the formatting of the legend. Often, the automatic title for the legend is not intuitive, since it is simply the variable name (in our case, *medhval*). This can be customized by setting the `title` argument in `tm_polygons()`.  Let's change the legend title to "Housing values"

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
tm_shape(sac.county.tracts, unit = "mi") +
  tm_polygons(col = "medhval", style = "quantile",palette = "Reds", border.alpha = 0,
              title = "Housing values") +
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 5, 10), text.size  = 0.75, position = c("center", "bottom"))  +
  tm_compass(type = "4star", position = c("left", "top")) 
```

Another important aspect of the legend is its positioning. This is handled through the `tm_layout()` function. The `legend.position` argument in the `tm_layout()` function takes a vector of two string variables that determine both the horizontal position (“left”, “right”, or “center”) and the vertical position (“top”, “bottom”, or “center”).  The default is "right" and "bottom".  But, we can change it to, say, top right.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
tm_shape(sac.county.tracts, unit = "mi") +
  tm_polygons(col = "medhval", style = "quantile",palette = "Reds", border.alpha = 0,
              title = "Housing values") +
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 5, 10), text.size  = 0.75, position = c("center", "bottom"))  +
  tm_compass(type = "4star", position = c("left", "top"))  +
    tm_layout(legend.position = c("right", "top"))
```

Yuck.  We can leave it at the bottom right. Or there is also the option to position the legend outside the frame of the map. This is accomplished by setting `legend.outside` to TRUE (the default is FALSE) in `tm_layout()`.  We also shift the scale bar to the bottom right corner. 

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
tm_shape(sac.county.tracts, unit = "mi") +
  tm_polygons(col = "medhval", style = "quantile",palette = "Reds", border.alpha = 0,
              title = "Housing values") +
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 5, 10), text.size  = 0.75, position = c("right", "bottom"))  +
  tm_compass(type = "4star", position = c("left", "top"))  +
    tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE)
```

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Map layout**
\

We can make the map *prettier* by changing a variety of layout settings within the function `tm_layout()`.  Check the help documentation for `tm_layout()` to see the complete list of settings.  Also see examples in Ch. 8.2.5 in GWR.  Let's change a few things to our map using `tm_layout()`.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = "hide"}
sac.map <- tm_shape(sac.county.tracts, unit = "mi") +
  tm_polygons(col = "medhval", style = "quantile",palette = "Reds", border.alpha = 0,
              title = "Housing values") +
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 5, 10), text.size  = 0.75, position = c("right", "bottom"))  +
  tm_compass(type = "4star", position = c("left", "top")) + 
  tm_layout(main.title = "2015-19 Median Housing Values in Sacramento County", main.title.size = 0.95, frame = FALSE, legend.outside = TRUE)
  
sac.map
```

We did a few things within the `tm_layout()` function

* We added a title using the argument `main.title`
* We made sure the title fits inside the map using `main.title.size`
* We eliminated the frame around the map using the argument `frame = FALSE`

Also notice that we stored the map into an object called *sac.map*.  R is an object-oriented language, so *everything* you *make* in R are objects that can be stored for future manipulation.  This includes maps.  You should see *sac.map* in your Environment window. By storing the map, you can access it anytime during your current R session.

Check the full list of `tm_` elements [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tmap/versions/2.0/topics/tmap-element).


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>    
### **Saving maps**
\

You can save your maps a couple of ways.

1. On the plotting screen where the map is shown, click on *Export* and save it as either an image or pdf file.
2. Use the function `tmap_save()`

For option 2, we can save the map object *sac.map* as such

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
tmap_save(sac.map, "saccountyhval.png")
```

Specify the **tmap** object and a filename with an extension. It supports `pdf`, `eps`, `svg`, `wmf`, `png`, `jpg`, `bmp` and `tiff`.  The default is `png`.  Also make sure you've set your directory to the folder that you want your map to be saved in.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Interactive maps**
\

So far we've created static maps. That is, maps that don't "move".  But, we're all likely used to Google or Bing maps - maps that we can move around and zoom into.  You can make interactive maps in R using the package **tmap**.  

To make your **tmap** object interactive, use the function `tmap_mode()`. Type in "view" inside this function.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
tmap_mode("view")
```

Now that the interactive mode has been ‘turned on’, all maps produced with `tm_shape()` will launch. Let's view our saved *sac.map* interactively.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
sac.map

Besides interactivity, another important benefit of `tmap_mode()` is that it provides a basemap, which was discussed in Handout 5.  The function of a basemap is to provide background detail necessary to orient the location of the map.  In the static maps we produced earlier, Sacramento county was sort of floating in white space.  As you can see in the interactive map above we've added geographic context to the surrounding area. 

The default basemap in `tmap_mode()` is CartoDB.Positron.  You can change the basemap through the `tm_basemap()` function.  For example, let's change the basemap to an [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sac.map + tm_basemap("OpenStreetMap")
```

For a complete list of basemaps with previews, see [here](http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/).  There are a lot of cool ones, so please test them out.

You can save your interactive map using the same methods described for static maps. To switch back to plotting mode (noninteractive), type in 

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
```

1. We are in the midst of a global health crisis marked by profound human suffering. Analyzing the demographic, health and job characteristics of communities reveals that some places are disproportionately affected by this suffering. Communities with no or unstable internet access are at a disadvantage given that employment, medical care (telemedicine), education and other important services are primarily conducted online at home. Let's visually examine the association between internet access and race/ethnicity in  Sacramento county census tracts.

a. Using the Census API, bring in 2015-2019 total, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic populations for census tracts in Sacramento county.  Check Lab 3 for the appropriate variable IDs. Make sure to bring in spatial data by using `geometry = TRUE`. Calculate the percent Asian, white, black and Hispanic variables. (2 points)
b. Bring into R the 2015-2019 percent of households without a broadband, cable, Fiber Optic, or DSL internet connection for Sacramento county census tracts from PolicyMap (from the PolicyMap site, click on Health, Computer and Internet Access under the COVID-19 banner, Without High Speed Internet Access, and No Cable, Fiber Optic or DSL). Make sure to clean the data. (2 points)
c. Merge the percent of households without a broadband, cable, Fiber Optic, or DSL internet connection to the **sf** census tracts object you created in (a). (1 point)
d. Create maps of percent non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic using quantile breaks.  (12 points)
e. Create a map of the percent of households without a broadband, cable, Fiber Optic, or DSL internet connection using quantile breaks. (3 points)
