<p>In this guide you will learn how to create a StoryMap using Esri’s
ArcGIS Online StoryMap platform. The objectives of the guide are as
follows.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Learn how to navigate ArcGIS Online</li>
<li>Learn how to add content to your ArcGIS Online account</li>
<li>Learn how to create a StoryMap</li>
<li>Learn how to share your StoryMap</li>
</ol>
<p>For this lab, download the files from Canvas (Files - Week 9 - Lab).
There should be eight files - six photos (lametro.jpg,
los_angeles_photo.jpg, pblk_histogram.jpg, phisp_histogram.jpg,
stater_bros.jpg, and vons.jpg) and two zip files (la_tract_groc_dist and
Los_Angeles_Metro_Stations). <em>la_tract_groc_dist.shp</em> is a
shapefile of census tracts and the distance to their nearest grocery
store in the City of Los Angeles.
<em>Los_Angeles_Metro_Stations.shp</em> is a shapefile containing Los
Angeles Metro Rail stops. We’ll create a StoryMap about grocery store
spatial access in the City of Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="comment">
<strong>A StoryMap of your final project is due 5:00 pm, March
20th</strong>. You must submit the link to your StoryMap and the Rmd and
knitted html producing all of the maps/charts/tables in your StoryMap on
Canvas. A peer evaluation of at least two of your classmates’ StoryMaps
is due 5:00 pm, March 21st. See the document

<h2><strong>Before you begin your StoryMap</strong></h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The main objective of this lab guide is to teach the technical nuts
and bolts for creating an Esri StoryMap. However, the real work is the
planning that goes into preparing what your StoryMap will look like.
Before you start putting your StoryMap together online, you should first
sketch it out offline. Outline what each StoryMap “slide” will present.
Figure out which visuals make the most sense. Sketch out which StoryMap
features work best with your story’s narrative and flow. In creating a
StoryMap, you should go through the following steps</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Decide what story you wish to tell and which StoryMap elements
you want to use to tell it.</p></li>
<li><p><a

</ol>
<p>Remember that the power of a StoryMap is the ability to present your
project findings in a user-friendly, visually powerful way. And as
described by this week’s reading (Lung-Amam and Dawkins, 2020), a large
part of this power is the ability to use StoryMaps to give voices to
historically disadvantaged groups in a community. Planning ahead will
help you unlock this power.</p>

<p>StoryMaps are web applications that let authors combine beautiful
maps with narrative text, striking images, and multimedia, including
video. The applications are designed to be attractive and usable by
anyone, which makes them great for education and outreach, either to the
general public or to a specific audience. We will be using Esri’s
version of StoryMaps in this course.</p>
<p><a
href="https://servicehub.ucdavis.edu/servicehub?id=it_catalog_content&amp;sys_id=50a851151b5798103f4286ae6e4bcb77">Esri’s
ArcGIS suite of software</a> is available to all UC Davis students. To
create an Esri StoryMap, we need to use ArcGIS online. <a
href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/get-started/what-is-agol.htm">ArcGIS
Online</a> is an online, collaborative web GIS that allows you to use,
create, and share maps, scenes, apps, layers, analytics, and data. It
provides a central location to store, manage, and share spatial data. We
need to use it to create a StoryMap because it is the place that holds
your shapefiles to display maps in your StoryMap.</p>
<p>Signing into your ArcGIS online account is super easy. Just follow
these steps</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Navigate to the UC Davis ArcGIS Online <a
href="https://ucdavis.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html">splash
page</a></p></li>
<li><p>Click on “Sign In” located at the top right corner of the
page.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the blue button “Kerberos Login UC Davis”. Instead of
the blue button, you might get a screen like the one shown below. If
this is the case, use the Enterprise Login section to enter the UC Davis

</div>
<div id="adding-content-to-your-account" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Adding content to your account</strong></h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The next step is to collect the files you want to include in your
StoryMap. This will include</p>
<ul>
<li>Photos (e.g. jpeg, png)</li>
<li>Shapefiles to produce interactive maps</li>
<li>Videos</li>
</ul>
<p>and other types of media files and spatial data.</p>
<p>Photos can also include presentation-ready static maps, charts and
tables that you create in R and save as jpegs or pngs. To be clear, you
would</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrangle data in R</li>
<li>Run an analysis on that data in R</li>
<li>Produce a presentation-ready table, chart or map presenting the
results of that analysis in R</li>
<li>Save the <a
href="https://crd150.github.io/lab4.html#Tables_for_presentation">table</a>,
<a href="https://crd150.github.io/lab4.html#Saving_plots">chart</a> or
<a href="https://crd150.github.io/lab5.html#Saving_maps">map</a> as a
photo image onto your hard drive</li>
<li>Bring the table, chart or map into ArcGIS Online to present in your
StoryMap</li>
</ul>
<p>A benefit of presenting your work through a StoryMap in comparison to
a written report or a PowerPoint presentation is that it allows for
interactivity, particularly with your spatial data. In order to include
an interactive map into your StoryMap, you will need to upload the
shapefile you want to map onto your ArcGIS Online account. This could
simply be a shapefile you download online and bring directly into ArcGIS
Online. Or it can be a shapefile you’ve wrangled in R following one or
all of the steps outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring the shapefile into R, which includes using
<code>get_acs()</code> or any of the functions from the
<strong>tigris</strong> package</li>
<li>Run spatial data wrangling tasks
<ul>
<li>This includes clipping tracts to city boundaries and summing up
points within each polygon</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Run non-spatial data wrangling tasks
<ul>
<li>This includes calculating new variables you would like to present in
your StoryMap</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://crd150.github.io/lab5.html#Saving_shapefiles">Save
the shapefile</a> onto your hard drive</li>
<li>Bring the shapefile into ArcGIS online following the steps outlined
below.</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

</div>
<div id="adding-shapefiles" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Adding shapefiles</strong></h3>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Remember from Handout 5 that a shapefile is actually more than a
single file. In order to upload a shapefile onto ArcGIS Online for the
purposes of creating an interactive map, you’ll need to put all the
associated files into a zipped folder. To zip files into a folder on a
Mac, check this <a
href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/compress-uncompress-files-folders-mac-mchlp2528/mac">site</a>.
To do it on Windows, check this <a
href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14200/windows-compress-uncompress-zip-files">site</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>la_tract_groc_dist.zip</em> zipped folder contains all the
spatial files associated with <em>la_tract_groc_dist.shp</em>. Ditto for
<em>Los_Angeles_Metro_Stations.zip</em> and
<em>Los_Angeles_Metro_Stations.shp</em>.</p>
<p>Once the shapefiles are zipped up, add it onto your ArcGIS Online
cloud using the following steps</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>After you’ve signed in, click on “Content” at the top of
page.</p></li>
<li><p>On the Content page, click on “New Item” on the top left of the
screen. Click on “Your Device”</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the files from
Canvas. Select the file <em>la_tract_groc_dist.zip</em>. It should next
say that you are adding a Shapefile. Keep the defaults and click on
Next. Provide a descriptive title for the file (don’t use the default).
ArcGIS online prevents files with the same title names to be uploaded.
Therefore, for the purposes of this lab, just type in “Los Angeles Tract
Grocery Distance (INSERT YOUR NAME HERE)”.</p></li>
<li><p>Tags are required when adding new items. These are like keywords
in a sense. Check this <a
href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-online/data-management/using-tags-effectively/">Esri
blog article</a> for some best practices for naming tags. For now, just
type in “Los Angeles”. Hit return/enter on your keyboard. Then click on
Save. This will lead you to an information page about the file you just
uploaded.</p></li>
<li><p>You’ll need to add each file one at a time. Click on Content.
Then follow steps 1-4 again to add Los_Angeles_Metro_Stations.zip. Give
the title “Los Angeles Metro Stations (INSERT YOUR NAME HERE)” and use
the tag “Los Angeles”.</p></li>
<li><p>On the Content page, you should see all the files you’ve
uploaded. Note that the spatial files will come in two forms: a
shapefile and a feature layer. We already covered what a shapefile is in
Handout 5. A <a
href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/feature-layers.htm">feature
layer</a> is needed to map the file online.</p></li>

<h2><strong>Create your StoryMap</strong></h2>

<p>StoryMaps are web applications that combine interactive maps with
multimedia content and text to tell your story. They work on mobile
phones, tablets, and PCs. Think of them as web-based power point
presentations that allow you to interact with maps.</p>
<p>Go to Esri’s <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories">StoryMap
splash page</a>. Click on Start a Story. Your <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMD8hBsA-RI">journey</a> has now
begun.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The first page is your title page. You can construct the title
page any way you deem fit. You can add an image or map to the
background. It can be all text. First, write in a title (“Spatial Access
to Grocery Stores in Los Angeles”). You can also add a subtitle and a
byline (e.g., your name and CRD 150). Let’s add an illustrative picture.
Click on “Add cover image or video” on the top right of the screen.
Browse to the folder you saved the Canvas files into. Select the file
los_angeles_photo.jpg and click on Add. You should see a nice photo of
the City of Angeles filling the background (can you guess where there
is?).</p></li>
<li><p>You can alter how the intro page looks by clicking on Design at
the top of the StoryMap. Under Cover, you can change how the cover photo
is placed. For example, clicking on <img
src="lab9cover.png" />
will put the photo in the background. Play around with the other options
to alter and enhance how your cover page looks.</p></li>
<li><p>If you scroll down, you’ll notice a <img
src="lab9button.png" />
and next to that the words “Tell your story”. Clicking on this is like
adding a slide on your PowerPoint presentation. Click on <img

and you’ll see all the features you can add to your StoryMap. We won’t
go through all of them due to time constraints, so I suggest playing

</p>
<p>After clicking on <img
src="lab9button.png" />,
click on Sidecar and then select “Docked panel” (you can test what a
“Floating panel” looks like on your own). A window may pop up telling
you what a sidecar is. A sidecar has a large media panel on one side and
a narrative panel on the other. As readers scroll through the narrative
for each slide in the sidecar, the media changes to match the narrative.
Here is an <a

<li><p>Sidecars are great for showing photos. Add an image by clicking
on “+ Add” and then “Image or video”. Click on “Browse your files” and
add the photo vons.jpg (Southern Californians know what <a

fill up the right hand side of the screen. Click on <img
src="lab9fig10.png" />
to edit features of the placement of the photo.</p></li>
<li><p>On the left side panel, click on <img
src="lab9button.png" />
and click on “Text”. Then click on “Heading 1” from the pull down menu
that appears. This will give you a heading or title for this particular
slide (I just wrote “Title goes here”). Underneath the title, click on
<img
src="lab9button.png" />,
and select “Text” and then select “Bulleted list” from the pull down
menu. Here, you can add bulleted text describing the image on the right
and other major points. You can also add a numbered list or just text.
You might get something that looks like below.</p></li>

slide.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also add interactive maps to your sidecar. Click <img

<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You can format how the map will look like on your slide. You can
zoom into Los Angeles by clicking on <img

on the bottom right. You can rename the layer. You can add a legend by
clicking on <img

want to always keep it open for the user, slide the button next to Keep
legend open. You can also go back to ArcGIS Online to edit this map by
clicking on “Edit in ArcGIS”. Play around with the other options to
alter and enhance how your map will look like. Once you are done
editing, click on “Place map” located at the bottom right of the
screen.</p></li>
<li><p>On the left panel, add a heading and text describing the
map.</p></li>
<li><p>Let’s add another slide with a map. Click on <img

and then click on “Add” and then “Map”. Follow steps 4-6 above, but
instead add the map “Los Angeles Tracts and Metro Stations” and add a
header and some descriptive text. You’ll notice at the bottom of your
sidecar all the slides you’ve added. You can toggle back to the others
if you want to edit them.</p></li>
<li><p>Let’s see what our sidecar looks like in action. Scroll back to
the first slide. Then scroll down using the bar on the right of your
browser. You’ll notice the text scrolling down with the image on the
right staying in place. When you reach the next slide, the new image and
text will pop up. You’ll also see the first map pop up and then the
second map with the stations pop up. Note that although ArcGIS Online
allows some interactive map formatting and editing, it does not always
yield visually captivating maps. If you feel a static map that you’ve
created in R is better, upload that onto your StoryMap. The benefit of
an interactive map is that it allows you while presenting and users
while viewing your StoryMap to explore the map.</p></li>

<div id="navigation-bar" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Navigation bar</strong></h3>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What if you want to give the viewers the ability to jump from one
section to another? You do this by adding a navigation bar to your
StoryMap. Story navigation is an optional story element that provides
readers with links to the main sections of your story. Story navigation
can be configured as a table of contents or bookmarks that allow readers
to go directly to different parts of a story. It also gives readers a
visual indication of their current location in the story.</p>
<p>To add a navigation bar</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Click on Design at the top of your StoryMap</li>
<li>Under Optional story sections, turn on Navigation. The story
navigation bar appears at the top of the story below your intro
page.</li>
<li>Hover over the Navigation bar, and click on <img
src="lab9navbar.png" />.
The Story navigation properties panel appears.</li>
<li>The navigation titles are based on any “Heading 1” you included in
your StoryMap. You don’t need to include all the Headers in your bar. To
take them out, deselect them from the panel. For example, we probably
don’t need navigation to both Percent Hispanic and Percent Black since
we intended them to be on the same page. So, we can deselect Percent
Black.</li>
<li>You can also change the navigation title in the panel. This won’t
change the heading title in the StoryMap, just the title from the
navigation bar. For example, Percent Hispanic isn’t a great navigation
title. Change it to something appropriate. When you make the change, you
will notice that Percent Hispanic remains the Heading in the
StoryMap.</li>
<li>To include additional navigation bookmarks, you will need to include
them as “Heading 1” in your StoryMap. Story navigation can link to
headings from the main body of the story, sidecar blocks, and the
credits section. You can include up to 30 heading links in story
navigation. Each heading link has a 30-character limit. To convert text
into a heading, highlight the text you want to edit and select Heading
from the text editing toolbar</li>

<p>You can continue adding more features to your StoryMap as you see
fit. One feature we will not cover are Map Tours. A Map Tour is a guided
tour that lets you lead your audience through a curated set of places,
one tour stop at a time. This is great if you are, for example,
highlighting different areas of a community. See Esri’s Map tour <a

<h2><strong>Final Project: Create a StoryMap</strong></h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Check the document final_project_description.pdf located on Canvas
for specific details for the StoryMap requirements. You will create and
submit a StoryMap presenting your community, research question(s), the
project’s aims and significance, methods and data, and results from your
data analysis. Submit a link to your StoryMap on the class Canvas
discussion forum before 5:00 pm, Wednesday, March 20th. If for some
reason you cannot share your map when sharing via “Organization”, you
will need to share it to “Everyone (Public)”.</p>
<p>For all the maps, charts, tables and other visuals created in R that
were used in the StoryMap, you will need to submit the Rmd and its
knitted html file on Canvas, also by 5:00 pm, Wednesday, March 20th. The
maps, charts and tables must be presentation-ready. The Rmarkdown must
be commented.</p>
<p>Completing your final project will generally follow these broad
steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify your community and research question(s)</li>
<li>Collect the appropriate data to answer the research question(s)</li>
<li>Wrangle the data in R</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This will likely involve both non-spatial and spatial data wrangling
tasks</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Analyze the data in R</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This will yield at least one presentation-ready table, chart and map
of results that you will present in your StoryMap</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Save the results on your hard drive</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If you plan on presenting an interactive map in your StoryMap, also
save your wrangled spatial data as a new shapefile. Zip up all the files
associated with that shapefile.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Plan your StoryMap, making sure to include all the necessary
components outlined in the final project description</li>
<li>Put your StoryMap together</li>
<li>Publish your StoryMap, and share the link on Canvas in the Final
Project Assignment Discussion Forum</li>
<li>Submit on Canvas the Rmd and knitted html document that show the
data wrangling and analysis you conducted for the final project</li>
</ol>
<p>After submitting your StoryMap, explore the StoryMaps that your
classmates uploaded. Reply with thoughtful commentary on at least two of
your classmates’ maps, highlighting areas where your stories intersect,
how your maps compliment and contrast each other and what you learned
from their StoryMap. You can also identify one aspect of their StoryMap
you liked and one aspect you think could be improved (be constructive,
please!). Each reply should be between 150-300 words. Evaluations are
due on Canvas (with a reply to their StoryMap post in the forum) by
Thursday, March 21st, 5:00 pm.</p>
